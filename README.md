# Inverse-Random-Under-Sampling
## Inverse Random Under Sampling( IRUS) on Stroke data

Imbalanced classifications pose a challenge 
for predictive modeling as most of the 
machine learning algorithms used for 
classification were designed around the 
assumption of an equal number of examples 
for each class. This results in models that 
have poor predictive performance, 
specifically for the minority class. This is a 
problem because typically, the minority 
class is more important and therefore the 
problem is more sensitive to classification 
errors for the minority class than the 
majority class. In this project, we aimed to 
work on the Heart Stroke dataset, with 
considerable class imbalance. We 
implemented Inverse Random Under 
Sampling method and compared the results 
of it with the raw data results.
